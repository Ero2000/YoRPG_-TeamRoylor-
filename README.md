Instructions on How To Play:

Startup:
To startup the game, first go to the file's location (directory) and compile it, then type java YoRPG.java.

Pre-Game:
Once you do that, choose your difficulty by typing the number with the corresponding difficulty type that you desire.
It'll then ask you what your name is, so type in your name, or nickname, or something humorous for yourself.
After that, it'll ask you what type of class you wish to be. Do the same for the desired class you want like you did with the previous step.

Gameplay:
When a monster approaches, type in "1" if you're feeling lucky, to turn on a specialized attack, and "2" if you want to play it safe.
Try to stay alive to the end of the dungeon!

Tips:
When encountering a monster, start off with a normal attack to see how much damage the monster can do, to see if you can do specialized attacks with minimal consequences for your health, especially if you're choosing a squishy (easy to die) class like the mage or rogue.
